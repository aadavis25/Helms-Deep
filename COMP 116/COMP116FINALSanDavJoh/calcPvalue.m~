% use chart to test whether p-value (z) is less than confidence interval of
% 90% (alpha=.1). if equivalent p-value is less than .1, then there is 
% significant evidence for us to believe that people are more likely to
% select a color when suggested through capitalization than if they select randomly

% conclusion: our calculation for the cumulative data set gives us a z-score of
% -1.644, giving us a p-value of .09. This allows us to say with 90%
% confidence that decisions were impacted and did not follow the
% mean value expected if choices had simply been random. however, due to
% the different distributions of our data, this statistical significance is
