%% Assignment Introduction: Final Project
%  In this assignment, we take user input using GUIs to get participants'
%  age, gender, and color selection given one of three different prompts.
%  In the prompt questions, we capitalize a letter in one of the color
%  choices to see if that capitalized letter subtly encourages the person
%  being surveyed to select that color. Their choice, along with the gender
%  and age, is then stored in a matrix to be analyzed using a variety of
%  different graphs.

%% Individual Color Graphs


%% Cumulative 3-D Graph

%% Conclusion
%  Through the graphs we can see that there's actually little correlation
%  between our "suggested" color and the color chosen by users. However,
%  there is a higher proportion of blues selected, perhaps indicating that
%  position is a greater factor in choice than grammatical suggestions like
%  capitalization.
