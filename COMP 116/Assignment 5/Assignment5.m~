%% Assignment 5 - Aaron Davis
% I pledge that I recieved nor gave authorized assistance on this
% assignment.
%% (1) Say (in text) how many pits and peaks were in map.
pitlist = findPits(map);
[pits, col] = size(pitlist);
% There are 57 pits in the map.
peaklist = findPits(-map);
[peaks, col] = size(pitlist);
% There are 273 peaks in the map.
%% (2) Display map as a grayscale image, with pits and peaks marked 
%% on top of it. You can use the following code to do this:
pits = findPits(map);
peaks = findPits(-map);
imagesc(map); colormap(gray); axis equal
hold on
plot(pits(:,2),pits(:,1),'ro');
plot(peaks(:,2),peaks(:,1),'g+');
hold off
%% (3) Display map as a grayscale image with the path of a single raindrop
%% drawn on it as discussed above. The resulting image should look
%% something like the image at right (of course, it will be different
%% depending on what pixel was clicked.
clacPath(map);
%% (4) Compute the flow matrix as discussed above. Plot an image
%% of all of the pixels that have flow greater than 200. The output
%% image should be like the image at right
mapflow = flowmap(map, 200);
imagesc(mapflow); colormap(gray); axis equal;
title('map of flow>200')
