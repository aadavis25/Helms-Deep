%% Question 1 Plot a line graph of depths for both lakes. (Is there an obvious yearly cycle?)
plot (x1, jordepth, x1, falldept, 'g')
title('Depth of Fall and Jordan Lakes monthly 1985 - 2007')
legend ('Jordan Lake', 'Fall Lake')
xlabel('Months')
ylabel ('Depth in Inches')
%There is a slight pattern, but nothing very obvious or substantial.

%% Question 2 The targets for Jordan and Falls lakes are 216ft and 251.5ft, respectively. For how many
%% months was each lake over its target?

%Jordan Lake was over it's target depth 178 months and Fall
%Lake was over it's target 71 months.

%% Question 3  Plot the rain in August as a line graph over years for both
%% lakes.

x2 = [1:1:23];
plot (x2,fallaugust, '-r*', x2, jordaugust, '-b+')

title ('Depth of Fall and Jordan Lakes in August 1985 - 12007')
ylabel ('Depth in Inches')
xlabel ('Years after 1985')
legend ('Fall Lake', 'Jordan Lake')

%% Question 4 Compute the average height that Falls Lake is above its target for each month over the 23
%% years from 1985-2007, and display as bar chart with a bar for each month. Plot the line
%% for 2007 in red on top of this bar chart.

x3 = 1:1:12;
bar (x3, y')

title(' Amount Above or Below Average Depth for Fall Lake 1985 - 2007')
xlabel('Month')
ylabel('Amount Above or Below in Inches')
hold off

%% Question 5 Determine how many days had more than 1 in of precipitation at the two sites in hawrain,
%% and how many days had less than Â¼ in.

% Each site had 7 days with more than 1 in. of rain. Site 1 had 330 days
% with less than a quarter of an inch of rain. Site 2 had 324 days with
% less than a quarter of an inch of rain.

%% Question 6 Plot line graphs showing the cumulative amount of rain over the past year at both sites.
%% Which of the two locations (1 or 2) received the most rain?

x6 = 1:1:365;
plot (x6, cumsum(hawrain1), x6, cumsum(hawrain2), 'r')
legend ('Hawrain site 1', 'hawrain site 2')
xlabel('Days After 29 Aug 07 - 28 Aug 08')
ylabel ('Cumulative In. Of Rain')
title('Cumulative Amount Of Rain At Hawrain sites 1 & 2')
%Hawrain site 2 had the most cumulative amount of rain.

%% Question 7

%% Question  8 Determine the maximum increase and maximum decrease in height from one day to the
%% next for each of the four gauges in hawgage.
